# LibraryManagement
Montreal Library System is a android app designed for shopping the books. Here in this application, we designed two modules Admin, User. In the admin module, admin can add the books, delete and update the books whenever he want. He can aslo see the list of all books. In the user module, user has to register themselves to begin their shopping.

After login into their account, user can see the list of available books that are in our database, then he can select particular book and can see the description of that book. If he wish to buy that book, he can click on "add to cart" button to go to the cart page where he can select to proceed either for checkout page or go back to products page.
